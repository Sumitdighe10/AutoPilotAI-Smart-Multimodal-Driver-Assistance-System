# AutoPilotAI: Smart Multimodal Driver Assistance System

AutoPilotAI is a real-time, multimodal AI assistant for vehicles that uses driving data, environmental inputs, voice interaction, and predictive analytics to enhance road safety and driver awareness. It integrates Python, Flask API, OpenAI's GPT-4, Bluetooth-based car profiling, and sensor-based logic with optional Flutter UI for mobile platforms.

## 🚀 Project Overview

* **Goal**: Build an intelligent assistant that classifies driving behavior, monitors voice activity, detects road events (e.g., bumps), and provides voice-guided coaching and navigation support.
* **Tech Stack**: Python, Flask, OpenAI GPT-4, OBD-II, Google Maps API, WeatherAPI, TomTom Traffic, webrtcvad, PyAudio, Matplotlib, Flutter (optional)
* **Platform**: Windows (Jupyter/VS Code) + Android Studio/Flutter (optional)

## 🧠 Key Features

1. **Driving Style Detection** (Calm / Moderate / Aggressive) using acceleration data
2. **Voice Monitoring**: Detects speech using webrtcvad and simulates AUX volume control
3. **Bump Detection**: Identifies rough road conditions or speed breakers
4. **Real Fuel / Battery Monitoring**: Reads fuel from OBD-II or simulates EV battery level
5. **Smart Coaching**: Provides advice based on driving style, bumps, and weather
6. **GPT-4 Integration**: Natural language voice assistant via OpenAI API
7. **Lane & Proximity Alerts**: Flags vehicles nearby with proximity logic
8. **Car Profile Detection**: Auto-loads car model via Bluetooth MAC ID + CarQuery API
9. **Weather + Traffic APIs**: Live advisories using WeatherAPI and TomTom
10. **Optional Flutter UI**: Mobile dashboard to visualize outputs (driving style, fuel, etc.)

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AutoPilotAI.git
cd AutoPilotAI
```

### Step 2: Install Python Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

*Ensure you also install system-level dependencies for PyAudio and webrtcvad if needed.*

### Step 3: Run the Python Logic (Driving App)

```bash
python driving_app.py
```

This runs the complete simulation: detects driving style, bump, weather, voice input, and GPT-4 response.

### Step 4: Run Flask API Server

```bash
python api_server.py
```

Visit: `http://127.0.0.1:5000` to confirm the server is running.

### Step 5 (Optional): Connect Flutter UI

Use Android Studio or VS Code to:

* Open the `/flutter_ui` folder
* Connect to your emulator or Android/iOS device
* Update `api_service.dart` with your local IP address (replace `localhost`)
* Run `flutter pub get` and launch the app

## 🎯 Sample Output

* `Driving Style: Moderate`
* `Smart Coaching: Ease off on acceleration.`
* `⚠️ Speedbreaker ahead within 100 meters.`
* `GPT-4 says: Road is clear, you’re good to go!`
